# 5300-Instructor
DB Relation Manager project for CPSC5300/4300 at Seattle U, Spring 2020; Instructor Solution

## Tags
- <code>Milestone1</code> is playing around with the AST returned by the HyLine parser and general setup of the command loop.
- <code>Milestone2h</code> has the instructor-provided files for Milestone 2. (Note that <code>heap_storage.cpp</code> is just a stub.)
- <code>Milestone2</code> is the instructor's attempt to complete the Milestone 2 assignment.

## Valgrind (Linux)
To run valgrind (files must be compiled with -ggdb):
```sh
$ valgrind --leak-check=full --suppressions=valgrind.supp ./sql5300 data
```
Note that we've added suppression for the known issues with the Berkeley DB library <em>vis-Ã -vis</em> valgrind.
